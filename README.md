## The Ultimate James Bond Fan Site

Your client has an awesome James Bond website that they want to make responsive. However, they don't want to modify their existing HTML, so they've asked you to **only compose a new stylesheet**.

Notes:

- **DO NOT MODIFY THE HTML**
- Look up `max-width` (css).
- Look up `@media` (css).
